Hi, I am Deshrit *(day-shree-th)* !

I am a software engineer based in Nepal ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µ. I like to work in the backend and 
AI/ML  side  of the things. I like building  robust and scaleable applications.

Currently, I am working at [smart-contents](https://smartcontents.co.jp/){:target="_blank"}, 
leading two projects - a chatbot as a service and a AI based financial documents 
generation workflow. I am extensively using langgraph and postgreSQL for writing 
persistence and fault tolorant applications.

Previously I worked at [SecurityPal](https://www.securitypalhq.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Apart from work, I like to travel, trek and just live peaceful life.

## Interest:

- **Robotics & Research**: From the very young age, I was passionate about how things
worked and specially how can I make my own. I like to keep up with lastest advancements 
and findings.

- **Movies**: I like watching all genres of movies. My only ask - I should be never 
able to guess the ending until the very end. I aspire to  become a movie/drama director 
one day, not fulltime but just for a side quest - probably - maybe - or I will just 
change my mind ðŸ¤¦

- **Walking**: In the evening, I walk for at least half an hour a day along 
the bank of Manohara river. This has been one of my favourite things do since
the pandemic. 

## Principle:

- **Result Oriented**: I always like to evaluate myself based upon the outcomes.
I believe this way of observing helps ourselves to never divert 
from what we want to acheive and exactly shows where we are in that path.

- **Empathetic**: Being empathic makes us more human and brings people closer to one 
another.
