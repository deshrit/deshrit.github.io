Hi, I am Deshrit *(day-shree-th)* !

I am an AI and Robotics researcher based in Nepal 🇳🇵. 

Currently, I am building custom robotics hardware implementing and researching around 
monocular SLAM using Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Stepper Motors. I am also working on
personal entrepreneurial projects aiding the health care community.


Previously I worked at [SecurityPal](https://www.securitypalhq.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Apart from work, I like to travel and trek.

## Interest:

- **Robotics & Research**: From a young age, I was passionate about building things 
of my own and it naturally led me toward engineering, robotics and AI. I like to stay 
updated on latest advancements, trends and findings. 


- **Movies**: I like to watch all genres of movies and shows - animations, novels, 
history, thriller, crime, and many others. I want to direct a drama/movie of my own
if I could one day.

- **Walking**: Everyday, in the evening, I walk for at least half an hour along the 
bank of the Manohara river. I never 
want to skip this but sometimes the schedule does not cooperate!

## Principle:

- **Result Oriented**: I always like to evaluate myself based upon the outcomes. I 
believe this way of observing ourselves help us to never divert from what we want to 
acheive and exactly show where we are in that path.

- **Empathetic**: Being empathic makes us more human and brings people closer to one 
another.
