Hi, I am Deshrit *(day-shree-th)* !

I am a software engineer based in Nepal 🇳🇵. 

Currently, I am working at [smart-contents](https://smartcontents.co.jp/){:target="_blank"}, leading two projects—a chatbot as a service and an AI assisted financial document 
generation workflow. I am extensively using langgraph 
and postgreSQL for writing persistence and fault tolerant applications.

Previously I worked at [SecurityPal](https://www.securitypalhq.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Apart from work, I like to travel and trek.

## Interest:

- **Robotics & Research**: From a young age, I was passionate about building things 
of my own and it naturally led me toward engineering, robotics and AI. I like to stay 
updated on latest advancements, trends and findings in order to widen my knowledge  and
ability to solve problems more efficiently. 


- **Movies**: I like watching all genres of movies. I even aspire to become a 
movie/drama director one day, not a fulltime career but a side quest or maybe I will 
just change my mind, not so sure on this.

- **Walking**: In the evening, I walk for at least half an hour a day along 
the bank of Manohara river. This has been one of my favourite things do since
the pandemic. 

## Principle:

- **Result Oriented**: I always like to evaluate myself based upon the outcomes.
I believe this way of observing helps ourselves to never divert 
from what we want to acheive and exactly shows where we are in that path.

- **Empathetic**: Being empathic makes us more human and brings people closer to one 
another.
